# vinor

The project is to get an idea of the price difference, by wine, between France and norway. As Vinmonopolet gets deiscount for buying large quantities at a time, this might offset the alcohol tax thereafter applied. In theory, there might be a few wines where the price difference between the two countries is small (even negative?).

## Plan:
- [ ] get NOK/EUR exchange rate
- [ ] get prices from French website (consummer prices)
- [ ] add Italian, Spanish, other wines
- [ ] add DutyFree prices from international arrival in Norway
- [ ] track prices (low priority)
- [ ] some visualisation
- [ ] some way to access the info from outside (mobile). No experience on that
